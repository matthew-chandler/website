# 31 Days

I'm doing a challenge where I make a new website each day during July 2025 as a way to test out code assistant capabilities, learn new tools, and have fun!

??? "Site Requirements"
    - must be standalone (i.e. have a unique domain)
    - must be interactive
    - must be live -- pages aren't useful unless hosted somewhere!

??? "What's allowed"
    - can be completely static
    - can be mostly or entirely vibe-coded
    - can self-host or use a free hosting solution (e.g. Github pages)

Each day I'll update this page with a brief blurb and a link to the site. All frontend source code will be hosted on [Github](https://github.com/matthew-chandler/31days).
