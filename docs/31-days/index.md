# Overview

I'm doing a challenge where I make a new website each day during July 2025 as a way to test out code assistant capabilities, learn new tools, and have fun!

??? "Site Requirements"
    - must be standalone (i.e. have a unique domain)
    - must be interactive
    - must be live -- pages aren't useful unless hosted somewhere!

??? "What's allowed"
    - can be completely static
    - can be mostly or entirely vibe-coded
    - can self-host or use a free hosting solution (e.g. Github pages)

Each day I'll update this page with a brief blurb and a link to the site. All frontend source code will be hosted on [Github](https://github.com/matthew-chandler/31days).


## Day 1: [Sunrise and Sunset Timers](https://sun.machandler.com)

**Type:** Completely static

**Time Spent:** ~3 hours

**Host:** Self-hosted

First day looking pretty good! Simple website almost entirely written by [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) that grabs the user's location via IP address and displays sunrise and sunset times as well as some other interesting info. Some cool extra features are that the background changes depending on the time of day and you can also manually change the location. I probably shouldn't have spent so much time on this, but I kept playing around with Claude trying to add more and more features until I realized that I should probably be scaling back instead.
