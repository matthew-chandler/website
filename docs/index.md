# Hi, I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a currently a computer engineering student at UCLA. Though I mainly consider myself a software engineer, I've ending up mostly working on hardware projects and [internships](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandler-matthew/) in the past. In my free time, I like to read, meditate, and go on walks. When they're in season, I also like to watch the NFL and [League tournaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends_in_esports).

Feel free to add me on any of the social links listed in the footer! Recently, I've been trying to rate every book/movie/game I consume, and I'm happy to chat about anything.
